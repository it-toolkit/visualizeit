  ## Extendible Hashing in Direct Files example of the second remove algorithm

  In this example it is possible to create a file organized with the extensible hashing technique. Where you can select the size of the buckets that will contain fixed length records. It is also possible to select an initial state of the file.
  In the extensible hashing technique, the hash function will be used to access the table (hash table) of bucket addresses. This extensible version of hashing is also known as postfix bits because it considers the last bits of a record key to determine in the hash table the bucket number that the record contains.

  This example shows a simple insert and some deletions that generates some freed buckets and one empty bucket. The hash table ends up being reduced to the half.
  
  ### extendiblehashing-create
  It's used to create the file indicating the size of the buckets, and the initial records to insert.

  ### extendiblehashing-insert
  This command adds a value to the file acording to the extendible hashing method.

  ### extendiblehashing-remove
  This command removes a value from the file acording to the extendible hashing method.

  ### extendiblehashing-find
  This command searches for a given value in the file.
