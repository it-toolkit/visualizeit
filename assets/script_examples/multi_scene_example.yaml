  ## Multi-scene script example
  
  This simple script shows you three different scenes.
  
  1. Scene using global commands from the default extension
  1. Scene using commands from the "fake" extension
  1. Scene using commands from the "slides" extension

scenes:
  - name: First scene
    extensions: []
    title-duration: 5
    description: |- 
      Scene with long title slide duration,
      showing a _simple banner_
    initial-state:
      - background: ["https://images.pexels.com/photos/159627/pencils-clips-colour-pencils-foam-rubber-159627.jpeg", cover]
    transitions:
      - show-banner: ["Banner of scene 1", center, 2]
  - name: Second scene
    extensions: [fake_extension]
    description: |-
      Scene showing a _fake extension custom model_
      and a final *popup*
    initial-state:
    transitions:
      - fake-command
      - show-popup: |-
          The next scene does not use 
          the **default title slide**.
          It starts showing the initial state representation.

      - show-slides
