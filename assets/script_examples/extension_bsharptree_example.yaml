  ## B\# Tree example

  In this example a B\# tree is created, some keys are added and then one key is removed. All these commands cause changes in the tree,
  like new node creations, overflows and balancing the keys between nodes

  ### bsharptree-create
  It's used to create the tree with a maximum capacity for a node. It may receive a list of keys to initialize the tree

  ### bsharptree-insert
  This command adds a key to the tree, searching for the correct node to add it to, and rebalancing the tree, if necessary

  ### bsharptree-remove
  This command deletes a key from the tree, finding it and removing it from the node, and rebalancing the tree in case of an underflow

  ### bsharptree-find
  This command searches through the tree until it finds the node a value should be located, even if it isn't in the tree at the moment
